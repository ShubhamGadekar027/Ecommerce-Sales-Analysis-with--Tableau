# Ecommerce Sales Analysis with (Tableau)

This project involves the analysis of ecommerce sales data, likely with the goal of understanding and evaluating the performance of the business. The analysis is being conducted using Tableau, a data visualization and business intelligence tool. The data being analyzed is described as being "year to date," which likely means that it covers a specific period of time starting at the beginning of the current year and ending at the present. The use of Tableau may involve creating visualizations and dashboards to help visualize and understand the data, as well as potentially making data-driven decisions based on the insights gained from the analysis.
